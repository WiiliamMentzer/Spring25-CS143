        // Put your answer for #1 here:

        /*
            Recursion is when you call method on itself,
            its different from an iterative method because when iterating through an object you have a definite iteration length.
            With recursion the values you put into it changes and depending on how a recursive function is built, you can create a while loop. 
        */

        // Put your answer for #2 here:

        //Base case is what happens when the method base starts,
        //the recursive case is what happens when you call the method in the method thats the recusive part. 
        //A recursive method needs both becuse if youre not calling the method on itself, its not recursion.
